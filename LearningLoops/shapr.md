# Learning Loops

Gamification works because of explicit visible progress

When taking a class, quizzes and other non-final tests allow course correction. You learn a thing, then you get feedback on how well you learned those things. I strongly dislike classes that do not support course correction through small tests.

Starting with a working base something allows a learner to make non-breaking changes. Related, learners gain benefit from quick and easy reset, whether that's git reset or something else.

The emotional reaction to intial exposure is so very important, ask me how I know :-|

Big important requirements for getting better at something:
- some way to get unstuck
- deliberate practice
- specific goal

Introductory tutorials: hello world! There's way more happening in a hello world than is usually described.

Pull condition? I hadn't thought of this before.

Problem sets must be at least vaguely interesting, I agree!
