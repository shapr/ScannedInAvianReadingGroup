# Examples:
- "Achievement buzz" - I definitely identify with this and how it connects to me as a visual learner. I feel a lot more accomplished creating a visualization I can share rather than all the "plumbing" associated with getting the data to make it.

- Intrinsic motivation goes hand in hand with learning loops (though an extrinsic accomplishment like "finish all the problems in a book" seems to go against that a bit?)

# Generalizability of this approach
- Ironically structural engineering *should* be something that is achievable through learning loops. There aren't *that* many labs associated with it, the teaching material just really isn't presented well.

- Peak as a possible reading group book?

# Projects
- as much as I hated the PBL class I took at Stanford that was completely open ended, the skills I gained from having so many unknowns served me really well in my initial jobs. Don't think it's made me great as a potential software employee though!
