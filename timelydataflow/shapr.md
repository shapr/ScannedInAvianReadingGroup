# Timely Dataflow

Here's the (original paper)[https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~abadi/Papers/naiad_final.pdf] .

I started by reading (acolyer's blog post)[https://blog.acolyer.org/2015/06/12/naiad-a-timely-dataflow-system/] and then reading the paper itself.

Jamie Brandon work in this area was the motivation for my original interest, starting with his (dida project)[https://github.com/jamii/dida]. From that repository, I found (why)[https://github.com/jamii/dida/blob/main/docs/why.md] most helpful.

There's a companion paper (posted)[https://blog.acolyer.org/2015/06/17/differential-dataflow/] by acolyer that might also help.
