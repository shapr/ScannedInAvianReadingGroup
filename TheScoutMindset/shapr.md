# Chapter 1 Two Types of Thinking

* I (shae) would rather know the painful truth than believe a comfortable lie
* The downside of assuming others are right is that everyone makes mistakes, you need to understand the information you can get for yourself.

# Chapter 2 What the Soldier is Protecting

* "Does motivated reasoning benefit us in important ways? What might we lose if we give it up?" I like to say "Why do you think that? What evidence do you have that convinced you this is true?"
* "Perhaps mortality is a blessing" I read some meta-research that said scientific fields sometimes show a burst of progress after their strong leaders die. So yes, I do think mortality can be a blessing.
* On the psychology of disaster preparation, last year I was linked to [Disaster planning for less crazy folk](https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/prep/) which I choose to modify with an opportunity cost calculation.
* "Grades aren't that important after all" I entirely agree! and yet, my grades were highest when I foccuse on long term retention of as much as possible, I was on the honor roll!
* "Deferring to consensus is often a wise heuristic, since you can't investigate everything for yourself, and other people know things you don't" Yes! I agree! And yet, a few hours was sufficient to teach myself enough virology to be skeptical of the paper "COVID-19 was made in a lab and here's why I think so". So there's also a case for doing a quick self-introduction.
* "People who identify strongly as X feel insulted when X is criticized" Well yeah, choose your identity carefully! I do not identify as Haskell programmer, or a variety of other things that people have told me compose parts of my identity.
* "Cutting down the tall poppy" This is a central part of the scandinavian mindset, called lagom, which translates into "just right" or "just enough" it's very much the Goldilocks approach to life. Swedish culture does not allow its participants to be stupid or brilliant! I have many stories on this topic.
* "Rather than boosting your self-esteem by denying your flaws, you could instead boost your self-esteem by noticing and fixing those flaws." Okay sure, but I feel like this whole approach to self-esteem is suboptimal.
