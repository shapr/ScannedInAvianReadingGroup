# Chapter 1 Two Types of Thinking

* I (shae) would rather know the painful truth than believe a comfortable lie
* The downside of assuming others are right is that everyone makes mistakes, you need to understand the information you can get for yourself.

# Chapter 2 What the Soldier is Protecting

* "Does motivated reasoning benefit us in important ways? What might we lose if we give it up?" I like to say "Why do you think that? What evidence do you have that convinced you this is true?"
* "Perhaps mortality is a blessing" I read some meta-research that said scientific fields sometimes show a burst of progress after their strong leaders die. So yes, I do think mortality can be a blessing.
* On the psychology of disaster preparation, last year I was linked to [Disaster planning for less crazy folk](https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/prep/) which I choose to modify with an opportunity cost calculation.
* "Grades aren't that important after all" I entirely agree! and yet, my grades were highest when I foccuse on long term retention of as much as possible, I was on the honor roll!
* "Deferring to consensus is often a wise heuristic, since you can't investigate everything for yourself, and other people know things you don't" Yes! I agree! And yet, a few hours was sufficient to teach myself enough virology to be skeptical of the paper "COVID-19 was made in a lab and here's why I think so". So there's also a case for doing a quick self-introduction.
* "People who identify strongly as X feel insulted when X is criticized" Well yeah, choose your identity carefully! I do not identify as Haskell programmer, or a variety of other things that people have told me compose parts of my identity.
* "Cutting down the tall poppy" This is a central part of the scandinavian mindset, called [lagom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagom), which translates into "just right" or "just enough" it's very much the Goldilocks approach to life. Swedish culture does not allow its participants to be stupid or brilliant! I have many stories on this topic.
* "Rather than boosting your self-esteem by denying your flaws, you could instead boost your self-esteem by noticing and fixing those flaws." Okay sure, but I feel like this whole approach to self-esteem is suboptimal.

# Chapter 3 Truth is more valuable than we realize

* "solder mindset helps us maintain beliefs that boost our self-esteem" Doesn't that already mean we value the wrong things? I disagree with this entirely.
* "soldier mindset helps us fit into social groups" No, I don't do that. But I have mostly been an outcast. I'm okay with that tradeoff.
* "scout mindset to fix problems" No, to *perceive* problems!
* I think the scout mindset is great for perceive/understand/design, and the soldier mindset is great for executing on the decisions from the scout viewpoint. I perceive a false dichotomy here?
* "solder mindset to fight off doubts about your community's beliefs and values" no, no no! I am not my community! I am not a number!
* I recently read "there are two kinds of people, those who sacrifice themselves for the good of others, and those who sacrifice others for their own good." This is also a false dichotomy, you can have both at the same time! Neither scout nor soldier are better than each other, you need both in equal proportion.
* present bias - I read a tumblr post long ago "Pretend you're a demon possessing a human body, and you go back to hell when the body wears out. Take care of your body from that viewpoint!" I do choose immediate benefits over delayed benefits, but I also spend a decent chunk of my time improving life for my future self.
* scout mindset is how you get to the gym? I thought scout mindset was perceiving the truth? I use the stubborn soldier mindset to get myself to the gym in the morning. "I said I would do this, AND I'M DOING IT RIGHT NOW!" Maybe I'm misunderstanding scout vs soldier?
* Yes, building good habits is difficult but has a huge payoff.
* Keep a decision journal, write down what you decided and why. That will help you understand how you make good and bad decisions? Maybe just have a feedback loop in general where you consider which parts of your life are giving you benefit?

## We overestimate social costs
* Yes, we do. But I'd rather look stupid while asking a question than pretend to be smart and never understand.
* Do what you think is right, even if others are doing something different. But you better be able to clearly explain to yourself why you are doing things that way!
* Is this whole book written by the author to the author? I'm not convinced I'm as vulnerable to social influences as the author. My mother tried to instill that in me for my entire childhood, and still gets grumpy about that.
* scout mindset more useful now than for our ancestors? I don't believe that at all. We have the word scout because it was valuable to our ancestors?

# Chapter 4 Signs of a Scout

* Am I the asshole? We all have blind spots for some things, and at different times. Have some friends you trust, ask several of them if that thing is unreasonable? That's what I do at least.
* When I'm asked a question where I don't have the answer, I try to come up with facts/information that would lend support to different answers, and then try to track down that information/facts.
* I try to figure out what things I *want* to believe (Haskell is just better) and then I try to figure out why that might *not* be true. (People are not stupid, and people rarely learn Haskell, why might that be?) I also try to figure out what I do *not want* to believe (golang is a great programming language) and figure out why that might not be true. (People are not stupid, and many people learn golang, why might that be?)
* For me, it was important to realize how I identify myself. I find it extremely difficult to challenge those things that are involved in my self-definition. So, I try to keep my self-definition as small as possible.
* Yes, I try to prove myself wrong, it is not as difficult as I would like.
* I like to think my best critics are my closest friends. I learn more from my critics than my supporters. "Success is not a good teacher."

# Chapter 5 Noticing Bias

* In college the first time around, I used to practice exploiting attentional blindness in others in hopes it would improve my own self. I had some improvement, but I'm still easy to fool in a bunch of cases.
