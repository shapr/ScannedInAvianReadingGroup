# Chapter 1 Two Types of Thinking

* I (shae) would rather know the painful truth than believe a comfortable lie
* The downside of assuming others are right is that everyone makes mistakes, you need to understand the information you can get for yourself.

# Chapter 2 What the Soldier is Protecting

* "Does motivated reasoning benefit us in important ways? What might we lose if we give it up?" I like to say "Why do you think that? What evidence do you have that convinced you this is true?"
* "Perhaps mortality is a blessing" I read some meta-research that said scientific fields sometimes show a burst of progress after their strong leaders die. So yes, I do think mortality can be a blessing.
* On the psychology of disaster preparation, last year I was linked to [Disaster planning for less crazy folk](https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/prep/) which I choose to modify with an opportunity cost calculation.
* "Grades aren't that important after all" I entirely agree! and yet, my grades were highest when I foccuse on long term retention of as much as possible, I was on the honor roll!
* "Deferring to consensus is often a wise heuristic, since you can't investigate everything for yourself, and other people know things you don't" Yes! I agree! And yet, a few hours was sufficient to teach myself enough virology to be skeptical of the paper "COVID-19 was made in a lab and here's why I think so". So there's also a case for doing a quick self-introduction.
* "People who identify strongly as X feel insulted when X is criticized" Well yeah, choose your identity carefully! I do not identify as Haskell programmer, or a variety of other things that people have told me compose parts of my identity.
* "Cutting down the tall poppy" This is a central part of the scandinavian mindset, called [lagom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagom), which translates into "just right" or "just enough" it's very much the Goldilocks approach to life. Swedish culture does not allow its participants to be stupid or brilliant! I have many stories on this topic.
* "Rather than boosting your self-esteem by denying your flaws, you could instead boost your self-esteem by noticing and fixing those flaws." Okay sure, but I feel like this whole approach to self-esteem is suboptimal.

# Chapter 3 Truth is more valuable than we realize

* "solder mindset helps us maintain beliefs that boost our self-esteem" Doesn't that already mean we value the wrong things? I disagree with this entirely.
* "soldier mindset helps us fit into social groups" No, I don't do that. But I have mostly been an outcast. I'm okay with that tradeoff.
* "scout mindset to fix problems" No, to *perceive* problems!
* I think the scout mindset is great for perceive/understand/design, and the soldier mindset is great for executing on the decisions from the scout viewpoint. I perceive a false dichotomy here?
* "solder mindset to fight off doubts about your community's beliefs and values" no, no no! I am not my community! I am not a number!
* I recently read "there are two kinds of people, those who sacrifice themselves for the good of others, and those who sacrifice others for their own good." This is also a false dichotomy, you can have both at the same time! Neither scout nor soldier are better than each other, you need both in equal proportion.
* present bias - I read a tumblr post long ago "Pretend you're a demon possessing a human body, and you go back to hell when the body wears out. Take care of your body from that viewpoint!" I do choose immediate benefits over delayed benefits, but I also spend a decent chunk of my time improving life for my future self.
* scout mindset is how you get to the gym? I thought scout mindset was perceiving the truth? I use the stubborn soldier mindset to get myself to the gym in the morning. "I said I would do this, AND I'M DOING IT RIGHT NOW!" Maybe I'm misunderstanding scout vs soldier?
* Yes, building good habits is difficult but has a huge payoff.
* Keep a decision journal, write down what you decided and why. That will help you understand how you make good and bad decisions? Maybe just have a feedback loop in general where you consider which parts of your life are giving you benefit?

## We overestimate social costs
* Yes, we do. But I'd rather look stupid while asking a question than pretend to be smart and never understand.
* Do what you think is right, even if others are doing something different. But you better be able to clearly explain to yourself why you are doing things that way!
* Is this whole book written by the author to the author? I'm not convinced I'm as vulnerable to social influences as the author. My mother tried to instill that in me for my entire childhood, and still gets grumpy about that.
* scout mindset more useful now than for our ancestors? I don't believe that at all. We have the word scout because it was valuable to our ancestors?

# Chapter 4 Signs of a Scout

* Am I the asshole? We all have blind spots for some things, and at different times. Have some friends you trust, ask several of them if that thing is unreasonable? That's what I do at least.
* When I'm asked a question where I don't have the answer, I try to come up with facts/information that would lend support to different answers, and then try to track down that information/facts.
* I try to figure out what things I *want* to believe (Haskell is just better) and then I try to figure out why that might *not* be true. (People are not stupid, and people rarely learn Haskell, why might that be?) I also try to figure out what I do *not want* to believe (golang is a great programming language) and figure out why that might not be true. (People are not stupid, and many people learn golang, why might that be?)
* For me, it was important to realize how I identify myself. I find it extremely difficult to challenge those things that are involved in my self-definition. So, I try to keep my self-definition as small as possible.
* Yes, I try to prove myself wrong, it is not as difficult as I would like.
* I like to think my best critics are my closest friends. I learn more from my critics than my supporters. "Success is not a good teacher."

# Chapter 5 Noticing Bias

* In college the first time around, I used to practice exploiting attentional blindness in others in hopes it would improve my own self. I had some improvement, but I'm still easy to fool in a bunch of cases.
* I've had ad hominem attacks applied to me enough times that I would not use adultery as a reason to ignore information I got from someone.
* My girlfriend organized a communication workshop at a phone phreaker conference. We had to spend the first five minutes describing the person at work who made us angry. The next five minutes we had to pretend to be that person, we had to say what they would say if they heard what we'd said in the first five minutes. A third of the workshop attendees stood up and walked out when they heard that instruction. I stayed and gained more insight into that work person that made me so angry. It wasn't an easy brain stretch though!
* I make myself a hard condition to follow when I'm not stressed, and then blindly follow that condition when I am stressed. That's why I quit my last job, because the conditions I'd written down for myself were violated. But at the time I didn't want to quit and abandon my coworkers. Months later I knew I had done the right thing.
* Yeah, these thought experiments are good, but golly do there have to be so many anecdotes?
* I did an experiment where I got a friend to give me a CD they thought I'd hate, but tell me I'd like it, and do the opposite with another CD. I discovered I really did like the CD they said I'd like, even after they told me why they thought I would not like it. Because of that, I try to expose myself to new music without the influence of others, and I try to be aware of how easily I can be influenced!

# Chapter 6 How sure are you?

* Spock is a TV character, I'd rather see someone like a politician making predictions, still fun though.
* Beth says: this book does not train the skill, law school does
* Beth and I went through the test in the book, I almost always rated my answers with higher certainty, but we didn't do the final tally.
* On betting, I realize exercise is a bet that the time sacrificed will pay off in the future, so far that's been correct! If a giant meteor was about to hit earth, that bet would not pay off.
* The equivalent bet test sounds like a way to reformulate the problem as done with the [Wason selection task](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wason_selection_task) .

# Chapter 7 Coping With Reality

* Soldier gets you moving when things are bad, motivated reasoning can get me to continue doing a thing even when historically I've not done well. I got a Haskell job after about fifteen years of trying, yeah?
* To me this is where I blame myself, and use motivated reasoning to believe that I can and will do better next time.
* On reading the part about motivated reasoning as covering up part of reality, maybe I continue to misunderstand soldier mindset? What do you call the bloody minded conviction that things will be better if I try one more time?
* On making a plan, I tend to make a plan on when to bail out of a thing as soon as I see a stressful situation coming. That's why I left Europe in fact! I've noticed that my standards for when to stop doing a thing change once I get stressed, so I try to decide ahead of time, and then stick to the plan no matter how I feel about the situation.
* The self deception research sounds like it's full of bias.

# Chapter 8 Motivation Without Self-Deception

* The self-belief model of success matches my long haul on getting a Haskell job!
* My whole problem with anecdotes is the selection bias involved. You can choose anything to match what you want to illustrate.
* I do like this Elon Musk quote about trying important things even if they have a low chance of success.
* Oh yeah, the emotional toll of variance is high.
* I think accepting the possibility of failure lets you change the definition of success to "something that works out well" instead of "exactly that one thing I want to happen".

# Chapter 9 Influence Without Overconfidence

* Ah, I often see conflation of epistemic and social confidence.
* I'd argue that speaking with modest diffidence lets others "own" the solution as much as the person suggesting the solution.
* So, drink lots of coffee so you can exude social confidence? I dunno about this.
* I'd argue the uncertain doctors who can give some useful information appear more knowledgeable than those who say they have no clue.
* setting expectations is important in all things
* I do like the 1. show uncertainty is justified 2. give informed estimates and 3. have a plan ; that's great!
* Yeah, when given choices designed to force you to make a bad choice, look for the other options you weren't given, they are always there.

# Chapter 10 How to Be Wrong

* I want to read more about Tetlock's forecasting research
* "What made the superforecasters so great at being right was that they were great at being wrong
* Change your mind all the time, subtle revisions as new information is discovered
* ACTION ITEM: Whenever someone cites something to support their argument, chase down the reference and read it yourself.
* This climate change person is an interesting story https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Taylor
* Changing my mind frequently does sound taxing, except I would rather be right and unhappy than wrong.
* I wonder if forecasts is a good way to communicate with people who hold opposing views?
* My forecast, COVID-19 did not come from a chinese lab, my references include https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/gk6y95/covid19_did_not_come_from_the_wuhan_institute_of/
* It's easy for people to continue believing the same thing when presented with evidence to the contrary. For me, I want to believe Bernie Sanders would have been a better president, and should have been chosen as the Democratic presidential nominee, but I don't have any proof of that!
* Superforecasters *re-evaluate their process* when their prediction misses the mark by a lot. THIS IS GREAT!
* ACTION ITEM: Shae will create a public decision journal with percentage belief, and update when new information is given. Can I turn myself into a superforecaster? Is this what lesswrong is all about?!
* Projection is common! When something didn't happen as a forecaster predicted, they realized they were saying "if *I* were in that role, I would not have done that thing".
* superforecasters view errors as opportunities to hone their skill at getting things right, that way realizing "I was wrong" feels valuable instead of painful.
* changing your mind should not be a humbling experience, it doesn't mean you screwed up
* being wrong doesn't mean you did something wrong!
* instead of "admitting a mistake", think "updating your Bayesian priors" !
* I'm afraid the anecdote from Buck Schlegeris may be about a conversation the two of us had, hmm
* "Knowing you are fallible allows you to set expectations" yeah, don't be upset when you're wrong!
* "inoculate yourself against the horror of having been suboptimal"

# Chapter 11 Lean In to Confusion

* I see the point of the photograph, but I'm still grumpy about it. It's really low-res and I didn't get enough information, but maybe that's part of the point I should take away from this?
* Lack of evidence isn't a support for anything.
* Action Item: follow Darwin's practice of immediately recording opposing information since my brain doesn't want to remember it.
* Natural selection *is* sexual selection too!
* Darwin followed up on every observation that contradicted his theory, revising his theory in response
* Wait, was Tetlock's seven belief system defenses actually in chapter 10? Did I miss that? Was it revised out later?
* My first response to "this is kind of awkward" was 'Now we have a chance to reset and synchronize all over again' !
* Homeopathy Hospital: good practices can improve things, but it's important to know exactly which practices are the good ones!
* paradigm shift is equivalent to breakthrough, I think?
* On the topic of accumulated anomalies, does this mean statistics should not discard outliers? I want hard info on this topic!
* Lesson: separate observations from theories.
* Funny story from a few months ago: The screen on my work mac would change background hue at what appeared to be random times. The only connection I could find was that it happened most often when my software test suite would alternately fail and succeed, and when I was sitting near the screen. It took me several days to consider placing my [test suite status display](https://github.com/shapr/bloohm) near the screen, because the only hypothesis that fit the data was "screen changes color depending on whether my tests pass or fail" and I couldn't easily fit that into my reality!

# Chapter 12 Escape Your Echo Chamber

* Listening to someone else's echo chamber doesn't help?
* Listen to people you find reasonable,
* Listen to people who share common intellectual ground.
* Listen to people who share your goals.
* Team of Rivals doesn't always work. If they're not dealing in good faith, sure. Even so, diversity in team problem solving *will* save you time and effort.
* It's harder than you think. Oh yeah, I'm continuing my conversations with my Trump-loving sibling, I KNOW ABOUT THIS.
  * We misunderstand each other's views
  * bad arguments inoculate us against good arguments - maybe this should be "don't put an idea or person in a box and leave them there?"
  * beliefs are inter-dependent - yes they are! I suspect this is the largest problem of the trumpian web of lies.
