## Chapter 1 - Two Types of Thinking
* Motivated Reasoning - unconscious motives affect the conclusions we draw -- do I do this too much because I'm so frustrated with my industry? Do I try to find the flaws but not fix them?
* "When a coworker screws up, it's because they're incompetent, but when we screw up, it's because we were under a lot of pressure" -- old me feels seen
* Oh yay structures metaphors: deep rooted, rest on solid foundations, unshakeable, built on fact, buttress, fortified, reinforced, cemented!
* I am hoping this book is not anecdotes ala Malcolm Gladwell, my least favorite pop sci writer
* Accuracy motivated reasoning - seems to rely on asking lots of questions rather than just one, is this plausible?
* The scout wants to learn what is really there -- this is what I want to do as well! Please prove me wrong!
* Stress testing and mapping out conditionals... seems like what I do on a daily basis with structures and mind maps
## Chapter 2 - What the Soldier is Protecting
* "When you advocate changing something, you should make sure you understand why it is the way it is in the first place"-- this is why I'm leery of AEC startups with founders without a lot of industry experience. It's one thing to do something for 2 years and say it's dumb, but I want to see people that have 10+ years experience then saying it's dumb (no coincidence I'm around that mark now...)
* I've been gathering evidence for years about how AEC structures firms currently operate and seen that it's not very difference among leaders in terms of computation
* Oh lord, the dog cartoon meme that I use... all. the. time.
* if ____ it's because ___ framing to internally rationalize
* "Irrational optimism** -- symptom of Silicon Valley
* Deferring to consensus as a heuristic...
* Aaron has been challenging me lately on whether Python is easier to learn than Excel -- has prompted me to reexamine what people do like about Excel
* I've heard of tall poppy syndrome and it feels like that's why I've had a hard time in industry
* Leaving a community rather than challenging the norms seems like tribalism (and partly why the US is so divided)
## Chapter 3 - Why Truth is More Valuable Than We Realize
* Soldier functions in the table center around immediate comfort and needs.. how you perceive yourself and how others perceive you... Scout doesn't gaf what other people think? Maybe less good at the whole hearts and minds thing (which is something I struggle with)
* Apparently I don't care about belonging anymore as I've very much decided to live a less "traditional" life according to most structural engineers
* Is scruitinizing a plan for flaws too pessimistic? Stopping something before it can even be started?
* Rational irrationality hypothesis - two senses of rational 
* Every time you say, "Oh, that's a good point, I hadn't thought of that" - it gets a little bit easier for you to acknowledge good points in general...Every time you're willing to say "I was wrong," it gets a little bit easier to be wrong in general
* Revisiting tall poppy syndrome - issue of overreation
* Scout mindset is more feasible today? Are we going to have anecdotes about how iconoclasts follow the scout mindset?
## Chapter 4 - Signs of a Scout
* Cognitive dissonance? very smart people can hold irrational opinions on things outside their area of expertise
* Issue of leading questions and bias in science
* How have I changed when it comes to personal criticism? I think quite a bit in the past 5 years
* 360 reviews 
* How much does bias and the soldier mindset fuck up doing good science?
* Lots of feelings about when I've been a soldier in the past...
## Chapter 5 - Noticing Bias
* LOL the outsider test is why I quit my phd..
*
