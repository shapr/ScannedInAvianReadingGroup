## Chapter 1 - Two Types of Thinking
* Motivated Reasoning - unconscious motives affect the conclusions we draw -- do I do this too much because I'm so frustrated with my industry? Do I try to find the flaws but not fix them?
* "When a coworker screws up, it's because they're incompetent, but when we screw up, it's because we were under a lot of pressure" -- old me feels seen
* Oh yay structures metaphors: deep rooted, rest on solid foundations, unshakeable, built on fact, buttress, fortified, reinforced, cemented!
* I am hoping this book is not anecdotes ala Malcolm Gladwell, my least favorite pop sci writer
* Accuracy motivated reasoning - seems to rely on asking lots of questions rather than just one, is this plausible?
* The scout wants to learn what is really there -- this is what I want to do as well! Please prove me wrong!
* Stress testing and mapping out conditionals... seems like what I do on a daily basis with structures and mind maps
## Chapter 2 - What the Soldier is Protecting
* "When you advocate changing something, you should make sure you understand why it is the way it is in the first place"-- this is why I'm leery of AEC startups with founders without a lot of industry experience. It's one thing to do something for 2 years and say it's dumb, but I want to see people that have 10+ years experience then saying it's dumb (no coincidence I'm around that mark now...)
* I've been gathering evidence for years about how AEC structures firms currently operate and seen that it's not very difference among leaders in terms of computation
* Oh lord, the dog cartoon meme that I use... all. the. time.
* if ____ it's because ___ framing to internally rationalize
* "Irrational optimism** -- symptom of Silicon Valley
* Deferring to consensus as a heuristic...
* Aaron has been challenging me lately on whether Python is easier to learn than Excel -- has prompted me to reexamine what people do like about Excel
* I've heard of tall poppy syndrome and it feels like that's why I've had a hard time in industry
* Leaving a community rather than challenging the norms seems like tribalism (and partly why the US is so divided)
