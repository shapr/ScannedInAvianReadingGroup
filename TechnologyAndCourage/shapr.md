# Technology and Courage by Ivan Sutherland

Courage is what it takes to overcome fear. Fear is an emotion appropriate to perceived risk.

## risks

* social and emotional
* reputation and pride
* discouragement
* charette -> feverish activity preceding a deadline

## external encouragement

* this reading group offers encouragement AND a deadline!
* could communities offer immigration courses? The Haskell community has many resources that aren't well known!
* practice talking about your work
* suddenly I appreciate tenure and teaching assistants more, as that encourages public speaking
* business plan is equivalent to a thesis proposal?
* now I want to buy all the stock options in my company and experiment with using that as motivation
* number of jokes told at executive meetings as an indicator of company health?
* Goodhart's Law again, short term profit is king, the USA doesn't have a long term strategy. "Nations with more courage are eating our lunch."

## self encouragement

* you need courage to start on new things (Am I stuck on Haskell? should I start on something new? action item!)
* opportunity cost - doing one thing means you aren't doing other things that may be more valuable
* people are especially fond of EMACS (ok, that's me, writing this in emacs, should I learn excel?)
* "Do something easy and carry it to the end"
* master's thesis as a warm-up project to get you prepared for a PhD project, interesting!
* Procedures! What I call habits, and Saul calls 'machines'. Invoke familiar procedures and break the task into smaller parts. Called 'discipline' and used to reduce perceived risk.
* DECLINE TRIVIA don't let the urgent drive out the important! (I do this far too often)
* change of location (I'm writing these notes outside in the sun), rest (I got 10 hours of sleep!), lack of distraction
* work hard to satisfy your own pride
* best able to do creative work when feeling cared for and happy, can't solve both personal and technical problems at the same time
* you must risk rejection slips or you'll never get published (action item, finish one of my stories and submit it)
* " I'm still reasonably sure no onewill care about my ideas on courage, but my deadline approaches." *laughter*
* treat an unfamiliar topic by making a list of things to say (that's how I write my blog posts!)
* Oh dear, now he's critiquing my parenthese, I shall try to write the rest of my notes without them.
* Display file memos remind me of MIT's HAKMEM that collected new and interesting tidbits of useful techniques and interesting ideas. Perhaps this is related to a zettelkasten?
* Repeat back to someone what they've said in order to improve clarity.

## rewards

* Does "smelling the idea inside the complexity" mean there's an idea worth ferreting out?
* "Scientific progress is the reduction of subjects from complete mystery to a more teachable form."
* "Follow your curiosity."
* "If you find something simple to explore, do not turn it aside as trivial, especially if it appears to be new." That matches the markov keyboard Darius and I wrote!
* "If the technology you do isn't fun for you, you may wish to seek other employment." and that's why I write Haskell instead of something else. I would like to point out [PoC||GTFO](https://www.alchemistowl.org/pocorgtfo/) as a wonderful example of this idea!
