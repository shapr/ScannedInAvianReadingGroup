* "Changing to a new job or a new school requires personal courage"
* "Usually the risks are more subtle but no less strong: they are social and emotional risks, risks to reputation and to pride; they are risks that are felt but difficult to identify and describe"
* "In research, we daily face the uncertainty of whether our chosen approach will succeed or fail... The special risk of research starts with the high probability that any particular attempt will fail and follows from the resulting experience of repeated failure."
* "When you have inadequate courage for a task, you can work up your courage, reduce the real risk, reduce your perception of the risk, or leave the task undone"
* "I like to collaborate with someone to whom I can express my ideas, even poorly formed ones, and from whom I can draw a fresh look at them" -- why I like pairing with Shae! Also, having the freedom to be vulnerable and unjudged as you figure something out!
* "All too often, thesis proposals are an afterthought to research already done, becoming at best an outline of the thesis document. I far prefer them earlier as a guide to the research itself"
* Practice in teaching is a good way to learn how to present ideas to groups -- exactly why I want to focus on technical but approachable writing!
* "Academia seems to me deficient in mechanisms to help people stop old and stale projects" -- research follows the money... explosion in ML in CEE "just because"
* "This may be why the energy and enthusiasm of youth are so important in research and in new businesses" -- I disagree to a certain extent; there's definitely a balance to be had in gaining the experience to then make things better rather than assuming up front that all things are bad.
* "My experience suggests that the most effective boards have a measure of fellowship that helps them seek wise decisions together" -- Familiarity breeds contempt - groupthink is an issue. Look at the damn board for theranos!
* "Personal courage is required to admit that one's skills to not match the business needs" -- exactly why I quit :(
* "One reason for the shortsightedness of business in the United States today is that the profit sharing plans for executives only consider immediate profit and not long-term growth" -- As humans we aren't WIRED to think long term. Just look at bloody climate change.
* "We desperately need governmental investment in the intellectual infrastructure of an educated populace confident of the long-term future. We have become a "now" nation to the extent of jeopardizing our future."
* "Recognizing that there are risks in starting anything new helps reveal the difficult of getting started as a reluctance to overcome those risks".
* "Are you merely building tools or are you doing something directly productive"
* "Everything we do has an opportunity cost of other things not done. I often use that cost as a reason for procastination, thinking that I am too busy, or that the investment of my time to learn something new is too great"
* Discipline as a sort of courage... I like it!
